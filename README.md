A project that shows _one way_ of combining the following: [Cucumber-JVM](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm), [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/) and [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/).

To run the tests, simply type <code>mvn clean verify</code> from the command-line. You may also run the tests, by executing the <code>RunCucumberITCase</code> file from within an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA)
